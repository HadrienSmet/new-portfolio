            <p>
                I am a passionate and enthusiastic front-end developer, recently
                graduated from a web development program. I love traveling and
                discovering new cultures, and I hope to have the opportunity to
                live and work abroad one day. In addition to web development, I
                enjoy learning new things, and exploring philosophy. I am a
                positive, optimistic, and dynamic person, always ready to tackle
                new challenges and learn new things. I am excited to use my
                skills and enthusiasm to serve a company and work on exciting
                projects.
